Boot to Recovery mode and select Command Prompt.
Inside the Command Prompt window, type the command: bcdedit /set {default} safeboot minimal. 

Press Enter on your keyboard and, after a moment, it tells you that "The operation completed successfully."

Close the Command Prompt and choose to Continue on the next screen.
Continuing to Windows 10

After your PC reboots, Windows 10 starts into Safe Mode. Log in with a user account that has administrator permissions. 


IMPORTANT: This method tells Windows 10 to enter Safe Mode automatically, every time you start it until you tell it not to. 
To get Windows 10 to boot normally again, run the same procedure one more time and type the command: 
bcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot.

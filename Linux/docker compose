Install Docker ComposePermalink

    Download the latest version of Docker Compose. Check the releases page and replace 1.21.2 in the command below with the version tagged as Latest release:

    sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

    Set file permissions:

    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


    Open docker-compose.yml in a text editor and add the following content:

    docker-compose.ym

        	

        version: '3'

        services:
           db:
             image: mysql:5.7
             volumes:
               - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
             restart: always
             environment:
               MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: somewordpress
               MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
               MYSQL_USER: wordpress
               MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress

           wordpress:
             depends_on:
               - db
             image: wordpress:latest
             ports:
               - "8000:80"
             restart: always
             environment:
               WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
               WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
               WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress
        volumes:
            db_data:

    Save the file and run Docker Compose from the same directory:

    docker-compose up -d

    This will build and run the db and wordpress containers. Just as when running a single container with docker run, the -d flag starts the containers in detached mode.

    You now have a WordPress container and MySQL container running on your host. Navigate to 192.0.8.1:8000/wordpress in a web browser to see your newly installed WordPress application. You can also use docker ps to further explore the resulting configuration:

    docker ps

    Stop and remove the containers:

    docker-compose down

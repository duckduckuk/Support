###First, make sure to disable /etc/init.d/motd,  as it writes to /var/run/motd.dynamic.

uname -snrvm > /var/run/motd.dynamic

---
RPI ONLY >>> sudo systemctl disable motd
---

###Then, just delete current static MOTD, create /etc/update-motd.d folder and place scripts in it.

mkdir /etc/update-motd.d
rm -f /etc/motd

---

###You can opt to get rid of the “last login” message if you want

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PrintLastLog no

---
###Add Scripts

cat > /etc/update-motd.d/10logo <<EOF

#!/bin/sh
echo
cat /etc/issue
EOF
 
MAKE EXECUTABLE...
chmod a+x /etc/update-motd.d/*

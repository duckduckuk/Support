Normal Fix:

pacman -S broadcom-wl-dkms

Advanced Fix:

The /etc/modprobe.d/broadcom-wl.conf file states “this file overrides the default blacklist in /usr/lib/modprobe.d.”

I had a look at that file and copied the 2 competing jerks into /etc/modprobe.d/broadcom-wl.conf, that is–
blacklist b43
blacklist bcma

now the output of lspci -vnn -d 14e4: states the following changes–
Kernel driver in use: wl
Kernel modules: bcma, wl

More importantly, speed are same as MacOS WiFi!!

Prior output stated–
Kernel driver in use: bcma-pci-bridge
